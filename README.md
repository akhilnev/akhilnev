üëã Hello there, I'm Akhilesh Nevatia!

I'm a software developer who is passionate about learning and working on new and exciting projects. My goal is to collaborate with like-minded individuals to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact.

üî≠ What I'm Working On

- Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in backend development and exploring the world of Machine Learning and Devops with Full Stack Development. I am extremely excited about integrating Open AI Specs into my projects and building new projects using them, and am working towards learning how to do the same!

- I am looking to explore MLOps and deploy my ML project using Tensorflow Serving. Any reccomendations on how to go about the same would also be great!

- I am also looking to start Open-Source contributing soon, which you will see on my page :)


ü§ù Let's Collaborate

If you have an exciting project that you think I'd be interested in, or if you're looking for a collaborator on an open source project, I'd love to hear from you! You can connect with me on LinkedIn or via email to start a conversation.

üå± Always Learning

I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and growth, and I'm always seeking out new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether it's attending conferences, participating in hackathons, or simply tinkering with new technologies in my free time, I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself and push my limits.

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
